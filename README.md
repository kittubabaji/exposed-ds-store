 Key Notes:

    "DSDB" is a magic byte signature in .DS_Store files, ensuring a valid file match.

    severity: low is appropriate, but this exposure can sometimes escalate severity depending on what files are revealed.

    You can optionally include a status matcher for status 200 to be extra certain.
